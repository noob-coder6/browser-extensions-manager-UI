### What I learned


During this project, I strengthened my understanding of **CSS Grid** and how to build responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.  
I also practiced managing interactive UI states such as toggling extensions and filtering active/inactive items.

Here’s a small example of a CSS snippet I’m proud of:



```css
.extensions-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 1.5rem;
  padding: 2rem;
}>
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus more on:

- Writing cleaner, reusable CSS using variables and mixins
- Improving accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes)
